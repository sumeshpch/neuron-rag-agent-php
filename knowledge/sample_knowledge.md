# Neuron ADK Knowledge Base

## What is Neuron ADK?

Neuron AI is an Agent Development Kit (ADK) specifically designed for PHP developers. It simplifies the development of AI Agents by providing a unified framework for working with various AI providers, embeddings, vector stores, and data loaders.

## Key Features

### 1. Multiple AI Provider Support
Neuron ADK supports various LLM providers including:
- OpenAI (GPT models)
- Anthropic (Claude models)
- Google (Gemini models)
- Ollama (for local models)

### 2. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
RAG is a powerful technique that combines:
- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base
- **Augmented**: Enhancing the AI's capabilities with external data
- **Generation**: Producing responses based on both the model's training and retrieved context

### 3. Vector Embeddings
Embeddings are mathematical representations of text that allow for semantic similarity searches. Similar concepts cluster together in vector space, making it possible to find related information even when exact keywords don't match.

### 4. Data Loaders
Neuron provides several data loaders to convert various formats into usable text:
- FileDataLoader for text files
- PDFDataLoader for PDF documents
- Database loaders for structured data
- Custom loaders for specific needs

## How to Create an Agent

To create an AI Agent with Neuron ADK:

1. **Extend the RAG class**: Create a class that extends `NeuronAI\RAG\RAG`
2. **Configure the AI provider**: Implement the `provider()` method to return your chosen LLM
3. **Configure embeddings**: Implement the `embeddings()` method to return an embedding provider
4. **Configure vector store**: Implement the `vectorStore()` method to return a storage solution
5. **Load knowledge**: Use data loaders to feed your agent with domain-specific information

## Installation

Install Neuron AI using Composer:

```bash
composer require inspector-apm/neuron-ai
```

## Use Cases

### Customer Support Bot
Build a chatbot that can answer questions based on your product documentation, FAQs, and support tickets.

### Document Analysis
Create an agent that can analyze and answer questions about large document collections.

### Code Assistant
Develop an assistant that understands your codebase and can answer questions about implementation details.

### Research Assistant
Build a tool that can synthesize information from multiple research papers and documents.

## Best Practices

1. **Chunk documents appropriately**: Break large documents into meaningful chunks for better retrieval
2. **Use appropriate embedding models**: Choose models that match your domain and language
3. **Monitor agent performance**: Use built-in observability features to track agent behavior
4. **Update knowledge regularly**: Keep your vector store synchronized with the latest information
5. **Test with diverse queries**: Ensure your agent handles various question types effectively

## Built-in Observability

Neuron ADK includes observability features through Inspector, allowing you to:
- Monitor LLM calls and their costs
- Track agent decision-making processes
- Debug prompt engineering issues
- Analyze retrieval effectiveness
- Monitor response latency and quality

## Production Considerations

When deploying RAG agents to production:
- Implement proper error handling
- Set up rate limiting for API calls
- Cache frequent queries where appropriate
- Monitor token usage and costs
- Implement fallback strategies
- Secure API keys and sensitive data
- Set up proper logging and monitoring
